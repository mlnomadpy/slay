## ANALYSIS CONTEXT

### Goal
Visualize how different attention mechanisms weight keys distributed on a unit sphere relative to a fixed query.

### What to Look For
1) How attention weight changes with angular distance from query. 2) Compare spread/concentration of attention across mechanisms. 3) Note symmetry and smoothness of the attention distribution.

### Expected Conclusion
Spherical YAT and SLAY show more concentrated attention around the query direction, while softmax distributes weight more uniformly. YAT kernels respect geometric structure.
