#============================================================

## ANALYSIS CONTEXT

### Goal
Visualize the structure of attention matrices for different mechanisms.

### What to Look For
1) Compare sparsity/concentration of attention weights. 2) Look for diagonal bias (local attention) or uniform spread. 3) Compare YAT/SLAY patterns against softmax baseline.

### Expected Conclusion
YAT and SLAY show more structured, concentrated attention patterns compared to softmax, indicating selective attention to relevant tokens rather than uniform spreading.
