## ANALYSIS CONTEXT

### Goal
Visualize where Gauss-Laguerre nodes are placed and their relative weights.

### What to Look For
1) Node positions (s_r = t_r/C) increase with index. 2) Weights (shown as marker size) decrease for higher nodes. 3) Larger R adds nodes at higher s values.

### Expected Conclusion
Lower-indexed nodes are both closer to zero and have larger weights, explaining why few nodes suffice for accurate quadrature.
